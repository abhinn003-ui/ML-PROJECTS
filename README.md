## üîç Project 1: Credit Card Fraud Detection
- **Goal:** Identify fraudulent credit card transactions in highly imbalanced datasets.  
- **Tech Stack:**  
  - `numpy`, `pandas`, `streamlit`  
  - `scikit-learn` (train_test_split, RandomForestClassifier, StandardScaler, metrics)  
  - `xgboost` (XGBClassifier)  
  - `imblearn` (SMOTE for oversampling)  
- **Features:**  
  - Data preprocessing & standardization  
  - Handling class imbalance with SMOTE  
  - Model training using Random Forest and XGBoost  
  - Evaluation with accuracy score & classification report  
  - Streamlit-based interface for interactive prediction

## üîç Project 2: Loan Approval Predictor
- **Goal:** Predict whether a loan should be approved based on applicant information.  
- **Tech Stack:**  
  - Python, Scikit-learn, Streamlit  
- **Models Used:**  
  - KNN, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression  
- **Highlights:**  
  - Achieved **83% accuracy** with Random Forest  
  - Improved recall by **10%** and precision by **15%** through feature engineering  
  - Interactive **dashboard for performance tracking** and threshold tuning
